      <p class="centered geist-regular">In the spring of 2024, I set out to create meaningful, low-cost adventures with my youngest child by visiting a new park every week. What started as a simple idea quickly blossomed into a year full of exploration, joy, and connection—we ended up visiting 68 parks across Utah, from Syracuse to Spanish Fork!</p>
      <p class="centered geist-regular">As our journey unfolded, I realized how many families could benefit from having a resource that highlights fun, accessible outdoor spaces. That’s why I created this website: to share our experiences, offer honest reviews, and inspire others to discover the incredible parks right in their own backyard. Whether you're planning a weekend outing or just looking for a new place to play, I hope this site helps make your adventures a little easier and a lot more fun.</p>

      <p class="centered geist-regular">Lehi Family Park quickly became one of our favorite places, mostly because of how much my daughter absolutely lit up the moment we walked in. She ran from one play feature to the next, climbing, sliding, and exploring like she had been waiting all week for this exact moment. One of my favorite parts is that the whole playground is fully fenced with just one entrance and exit while she’s off having the time of her life, I can breathe knowing she’s safely contained. The all-abilities design also means she can enjoy every part of the park without feeling limited, and it warms my heart to see kids of all needs playing right alongside her.</p>

      <p class="centered geist-regular">But the splash pad is where she really came alive. She squealed every time the fountains shot up, ran through the sprayers over and over, and kept shouting for me to “watch this!” even though I never looked away. Watching her bounce between the playground and the water with that huge grin made the whole visit feel magical. We ended up staying way longer than I planned both times we have come here, because she was just so happy. And honestly, I didn’t have the heart to cut that joy short.</p>
