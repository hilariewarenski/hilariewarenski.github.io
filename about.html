        <p class="centered geist-regular">Hello! My name is Hilarie. I am a married, full time working mom to three amazing kids and a very dedicated dog mom to four furbabies who truly believe they are in charge of the entire house. I have twin adult sons who have grown into incredible young men, and years later our family was surprised with a daughter who arrived twelve years after her brothers. She quickly reminded us that tiny humans can be adorable, outspoken, and powered by an energy source that seems to have no limits.</p>
        <p class="centered geist-regular">Life in our home is always loud, busy, and filled with a mix of laughter, chaos, and moments that become stories we share for years. There is never a quiet morning or a predictable evening, but there is also never a shortage of love or humor. From the constant movement of our kids to the playful antics of our dogs, there is always something happening in every corner of the house. It can be exhausting, it can be wild, and it can be wonderfully unpredictable, but I truly would not have it any other way. Our chaos is our life, and it is filled with joy, adventure, and more love than I ever imagined.</p>
