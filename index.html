                        <p class="centered geist-regular">Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I get to share five of our absolute favorite parks. As a mom to kids with endless energy, I wanted to find a way to take my child to fun places without spending a lot of money, and these parks quickly became our go to spots. We have explored so many playgrounds, splash pads, streams, and green spaces, but these stood out because they brought out the biggest smiles and the best memories. I am excited to share what makes each one special and why they have become our favorite places for everyday adventures.</p>

                <p class="centered geist-regular">Lehi Family Park quickly became one of our favorite places, mostly because of how much my daughter absolutely lit up the moment we walked in. She ran from one play feature to the next, climbing, sliding, and exploring like she had been waiting all week for this exact moment. One of my favorite parts is that the whole playground is fully fenced with just one entrance and exit while she’s off having the time of her life, I can breathe knowing she’s safely contained. The all-abilities design also means she can enjoy every part of the park without feeling limited, and it warms my heart to see kids of all needs playing right alongside her.
                </p>
                <p class="centered geist-regular">But the splash pad is where she really came alive. She squealed every time the fountains shot up, ran through the sprayers over and over, and kept shouting for me to “watch this!” even though I never looked away. Watching her bounce between the playground and the water with that huge grin made the whole visit feel magical. We ended up staying way longer than I planned both times we have come here, because she was just so happy. And honestly, I didn’t have the heart to cut that joy short.

                <p class="centered geist-regular">Brookside Park in Daybreak is one of my daughter's absolute favorite places to play, and it is mostly because of the little stream that runs through it. The moment we get there, she heads straight for the water, splashing, hopping across rocks, and creating her own little adventures like it is her own personal nature playground. She spends so much time there, completely in her element, with that huge smile she only gets when she is doing her very favorite thing.</p>
                <p class="centered geist-regular">The rest of the park, with its fun playground, open space, and friendly neighborhood feel, just adds to the magic. We always stay much longer than planned because she is so happy in that stream, and honestly, watching her explore and laugh makes it one of my favorite parks too.</p>
